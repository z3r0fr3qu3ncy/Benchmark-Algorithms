# Benchmark-Algorithms
Sorting Algorithms benchmark application in Java

This Algorithm Benchmarker measures time complexity of algorithms with test input cases of integers up to 10,000.

While not very OO we were awarded extra credit for building this as one monolithic codeblock so thats what I did.


Compile with javac ie/gmit/dip/*.java
Run --> ie.gmit.dip.Benchmarker
